                            &emsp;I dont like copying text and since im doing this late at night I dont really want to visit the internet to find a good context for this paragraph block.<br>
                            But an article looks plain if it only contains of a single line. Any text looks much better if it contains as much lines as symbols in a single line...<br>
                            &emsp; Yep, make a square, or a book with square pages, and your readers will be much more satisfied reading from square shaped source than from rectangular...
                            Especially when the longest side is horizontal...
                            <br> &emsp; Its sad that book creators dont know this secret... Atleast most of them...

                        <p>
                            &emsp; Its hard... Its not hard codding... Its hard writing text for these useless articles.. <br>
                            &emsp;"Why dont just copy?" - You may ask. Well the answer is simpe: Copy-paste is for the people whose goal is already written in thir... Lets say destiny book...
                            They just read a page and do what they are supposed to do. Thats most peoples` goal... I have a blank book, or atleast I think so... I write my own story and my goal is to achieve, not twice, not five times as much as them... I want to achieve as much as all of them... <br>
                            &emsp; Or maybe twice as much?? Can I do 5 times more??? <br>&emsp; Only time will show...
